#!/bin/bash
# runswmm_saves.sh - the Zig engine (bin/runswmm) for gate/gate.py, which runs
# `ENGINE model.inp report.rpt output.out` in the model's folder. The files the deck SAVEs to ([FILES], listed
# by savefiles.py from the swmm6-rust repository, called read-only) are backed up first and restored after, so
# a SAVE in the corpus never changes a file another deck USEs. The exit status is the engine's.
# SWMM_BIN overrides the engine; SAVEFILES the lister; TMPDIR where the backups go.
# savefiles.py also lists [LID_USAGE] report files, with '\' turned into '/' as OpenSWMM 6 does; EPA 5.2.4 (and
# this port) opens the name as written, so a Windows path such as C:\Users\x\lid.txt becomes one file called
# 'C:\Users\x\lid.txt' in the deck's folder. Both spellings are backed up and restored (lesson 29).
# A deck with nothing to back up runs the engine with exec, so that gate.py's timeout, which kills its own child,
# kills the engine and does not leave it running as an orphan.
